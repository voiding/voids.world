Thanks for checking out my shitty website! Feel free to make contributions as you see fit

# Version control and deployment

I use Vercel to deploy and host my website. To preview the current branch, look for the environments tab in the sidebar, choose the environment you want to preview, and select view deployment. This will take you to a snapshot of the site, pertaining to the respective branches.

Likewise, the production environment is hosted at [voids.world](https://voids.world) for quick and easy access.
